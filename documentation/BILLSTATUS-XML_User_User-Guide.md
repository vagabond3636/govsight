# 1. Introduction

At the direction of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, in support of the Legislative Branch Bulk Data Task Force ([footnote](#footnote)), the Government Publishing Office (GPO), the Library of Congress (LOC), the Clerk of the House, and the Secretary of the Senate are making Bill Statuses in XML format available through the GPO's govinfo Bulk Data repository starting with 2003 (108th Congress). The govinfo Bulk Data repository for Bill Status information is available at [https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS](https://www.govinfo.gov/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS).

Please see [https://www.govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/) or [https://www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/) for access to individual House and Senate Congressional Bills in PDF, XML, and HTML formats.

## 1.1. Bill Types

### Bills

- House Bill (HR)
- Senate Bill (S)

A bill is a legislative proposal before Congress. Bills from each house are assigned a number in the order in which they are introduced, starting at the beginning of each Congress (first and second sessions). Public bills pertain to matters that affect the general public or classes of citizens, while private bills pertain to individual matters that affect individuals and organizations.

### Joint Resolutions

- House Joint Resolution (HJRES)
- Senate Joint Resolution (SJRES)

Like a bill, a joint resolution is a legislative proposal that requires the approval of both houses and the signature of the President. It has the force of law, if approved. Resolutions from each house are assigned a number in the order in which they are introduced, starting at the beginning of each Congress (first and second sessions). Joint resolutions generally are used for limited matters, such as a single appropriation for a specific purpose. They are also used to propose amendments to the Constitution. These types of joint resolutions do not require the President's signature if three-quarters of the states have ratified them.

### Concurrent Resolutions

- House Concurrent Resolution (HCONRES)
- Senate Concurrent Resolution (SCONRES)

A concurrent resolution is a legislative proposal that requires the approval of both houses but does not require the signature of the President and does not have the force of law. Concurrent resolutions generally are used to make or amend rules that apply to both houses. They are also used to express the sentiments of both of the houses. For example, a concurrent resolution is used to set the time of Congress' adjournment. It may also be used by Congress to convey congratulations to another country on the anniversary of its independence.

### Simple Resolutions

- House Simple Resolution (HRES)
- Senate Simple Resolution (SRES)

A simple resolution is a legislative proposal that addresses matters entirely within the prerogative of one house or the other. It requires neither the approval of the other house nor the signature of the President, and it does not have the force of law. Most simple resolutions concern the rules of one house. They are also used to express the sentiments of a single house. For example, a simple resolution may offer condolences to the family of a deceased member of Congress, or it may express the sense of the Senate or House on foreign policy or other executive business.

Additional information about bill types can be found at [http://www.gpo.gov/help/index.html#about\_congressional\_bills.htm](http://www.gpo.gov/help/index.html#about_congressional_bills.htm).

## 1.2. Scope of Bulk Data

The Bill Status bulk data collection on govinfo includes XML bills statuses from 2013 (113th Congress) forward.

## 1.3. Bulk Data Downloads

The Bulk Data repository is organized by Congress and bill type. A ZIP file is available for each bill type and contains Bill Status XML files for that bill type within a specific Congress. Each Bill Status XML file contains information about legislation under consideration for a specific measure.

# 2. XML Descriptions

### `<summaries>` 
Parent container for summaries. Upon introduction of a bill or resolution in the House or Senate, legislative analysts in the [Congressional Research Service](https://www.congress.gov/help/legislative-glossary#glossary_crs)of the Library of Congress write a short summary that objectively describes the measure's significant provisions. Introduced version summaries are subject to length limitations as a matter of policy.

When a measure receives action (e.g. it is reported from a committee or passed by the House or Senate), the analysts then write an expanded summary detailing the measure's effect upon programs and current law. Bill summaries are written as a result of a Congressional action and may not always correspond to a document published by the [Government Publishing Office](https://www.congress.gov/help/legislative-glossary#glossary_gpo). A final public law summary is prepared upon enactment into law. 

Each summary description identifies the date and version of the measure and indicates whether there have been amendments: e.g. Passed House amended (07/19/2013).

See table 5 (below) for Mapping of LOC Action Codes for Summaries, Action Description Text, and Version Codes. The "Summaries" element may include the following children:

A bill summary describes the most significant provisions of a piece of legislation and details the effects the legislative text may have on current law and federal programs. Bill summaries are authored by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the Library of Congress. As stated in Public Law 91-510 (2 USC 166 (d)(6)), one of the duties of CRS is "to prepare summaries and digests of bills and resolutions of a public general nature introduced in the Senate or House of Representatives". For more information, refer to the User Guide that accompanies this file.)


# 3. Action Code Element Possible Values

This table provides codes and descriptions for possible values in the `<actionCode>` child of the `<actions>` element listed in the Elements section 2.1.

Codes in this table are representational of the codes that map actions with action texts related to a measure. It is provided as a courtesy; a complete, authoritative list of action codes does not exist. In general, expect action codes when source system is 2 (House floor) or 9 (Library of Congress).

Various code sets are used by multiple systems in the House, Senate, and Library of Congress by legislative clerks and data editors for functions independent of this bulk data set. As new codes and systems were developed, there was no coordinated effort to retroactively apply new codes to old records. Many codes are concatenated with other codes or elements or utilize free text. Codes in one set may be redundant with a different code in another code set.  Additionally, some codes may have been used and re-used over the years for different purposes further complicating the ability to create an authoritative list.

The original code set can be found at [http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ppmsca.33996/](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/ppmsca.33996/).

# 7. Data Set

Bill Status data is provided to GPO by the Library of Congress, and XML files are available for bulk data download on the govinfo Bulk Data repository starting with the 108th Congress (2003-2004). Bill Status XML files are not available through govinfo search or browse; they are only available in the govinfo Bulk Data repository.

In general, there are no restrictions on re-use of information in the Bill Status data set because U.S. Government works are not subject to copyright protection and are in the public domain. GPO and its legislative branch data partners do not restrict downstream uses of Bill Status data, except that independent providers should be aware that only GPO and its legislative branch data partners are entitled to represent that they are the providers of official Bill Status data.

Bill Status XML files can be manipulated and enriched to operate in the various applications that users may devise. GPO and its legislative branch data partners cannot vouch for the authenticity of data that is not under GPO's control. GPO is providing free access to Bill Status XML files for display in various applications and mash-ups outside the Fgovinfo domain. GPO does not endorse third party applications and does not evaluate how the original legal or legislative content is displayed on other sites. Consumers should form their own conclusions as to whether the downloaded data can be relied upon within an application or mash-up.
