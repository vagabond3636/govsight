My name is Mike Lane. I am a federal lobbyist focused on helping small and mid-sized cities, counties, and special districts secure funding and federal support from congress or federal agencies.

My core interests include housing, appropriations, disaster relief, rural development, and community resilience. I specialize in understanding congressional activity, grant programs, and agency funding opportunities.

I prefer clear, strategic, direct summaries that speak to city managers, mayors, and congressional staff.

I care most about helping communities in Texas, Florida, Arizona, and California â€” especially with projects related to infrastructure, emergency response, and economic recovery.
